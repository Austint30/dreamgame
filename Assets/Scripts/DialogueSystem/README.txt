To use this dialogue system, all you have to do is the following:

1. Create a dialogue holder and initialize it with the dialogueholder script
2. Create dialogue lines WITHIN the dialogue holder and initialize them with the DialogueLine script
3. You will then find all the customizations available to you in the Dialogue Line component
	(Font, Color, Character Sprite, Text Speed, Sound Delay, etc.)
4. Toggling "Change On Delay" will make the text move after the "Delay between Lines" value
	otherwise, it will change on mouse left-click (this is easily changeable in the script)
